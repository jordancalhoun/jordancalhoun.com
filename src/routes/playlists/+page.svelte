      <p class="pt-3">
        Hand cutting dovetails can be a slow & therapeutic thing. It allows your mind to slow down
        and think a little more deeply than it normally might.

        This playlist was created at a low point in my life, which is reflected in many of the
        song's themes. It is a series of songs that tend to lead my mind into introspection which
        helped me process a lot of my emotions and thoughts in a healthy way.
