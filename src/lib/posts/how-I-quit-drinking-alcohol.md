Today I wanted to talk about the steps and tools that I used to *finally* quit drinking.  My hope is that one other person out there finds this post when they need it most and that it is of some help to them.

## Introduction

I am not a qualified professional in any of these areas.  Opinions and statements are my own.  Speak with a medical professional before altering your intake.  

The following is a guide for what worked for me.  Take what resonates with you and toss the rest.

## Getting Started

**Start surrounding yourself with content that is about quitting drinking**.  This can be done while you're drinking.  This content should be interesting to you and should be done at regular intervals.  The key here is to form a habit of consuming content that aligns with the person that you want to become.  Hearing others' stories resonated the most with me.  I consumed a lot of the ["I'm Quitting Alcohol"](https://open.spotify.com/show/5sl90eruNwh5wABIILCS0b?si=f05b0167fecf48da) podcast, starting from episode 1. (Disclaimer: Lots of swearing).

Start by quitting quietly.  Overcoming an alcohol addiction is a very personal thing.  This shouldn't be about anyone else but yourself, so it's best to make sure we are not doing any of this for the bragging rights.  There will be a lot of failures and relapses before success.  I found it easier to get back on track when I do not have to publicly "reset".  

Prepare to be very bored.  Once you quit, you will find a lot of downtime reveals itself.  Make a list of activities that you can do to occupy these pockets of time.  We can't overcome a bad habit successfully unless we replace it with healthy habits.

## Getting To Work

Write as much as you can muster up.  Have a relapse?  Write about it.  Preferably as soon as you can.  I am not written by my nature, I'd much rather be creating something physical in the shop or creating something visual in the digital space.  However,  Journaling serves so many purposes, that it is worth doing, regardless of our skill set.  Let's go through a few reasons in a little bit of detail:

1. Having a diary of your past successes and maybe more importantly, failures will be a great ally when going through hard times.  They give you unfiltered access to what it feels like to relapse and how you felt the next day - without actually relapsing.  This can be a huge source of motivation to keep going.
2. Writing has been proven to increase one's happiness.  There are going to be a lot of downs, let's offset that with some systematic ups.  More on this and tips for writing prompts can be found on [this 15min episode of The Chase Jarvis Life Show](https://www.chasejarvis.com/blog/writing-makes-photographers-more-creative-5-easy-tips/).  

## After Success

After you have found your rhythm and are confident in your new self, then it's a good time to share.  For me, this took one year without a relapse before I felt like I could share my story.
